\chapter{ASR system - Business case}
\label{chapter:yield}
The Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) system performances are so far expressed in water volumes. The volumetric results are desirable, but it is hard to get a good picture of it. By the introduction of simplistic rules of thumb, the obtained volumes can be expressed in financial yield. This chapter offers a rough glimpse in the financial feasibility of an ASR system in northern Ghana. \\
The methodology of section \ref{section:Theory_yields} specifies the crops of interest and describes the derivation process of the pumping costs. Section \ref{section:fin_yield} presents the financial yield of respectively the first dry season crop-cycle (tomatoes) and the subsequent crop-cycle (groundnut). In Section \ref{section:pump_costs} the ASR system operational pumping costs are discussed. The agricultural yield is weighted up against the pumping costs in Section \ref{section:Yields_conclusions}. 

%This section contains the conclusions that can be drawn from the site visits and the analysis of pumping test data. The final part of this section describes how this data was used to derive parameters for scenarios to study potential methods for improvements of ASR systems in northern Ghana.   \\

%\section{Methods - ASR system financial yield}
\section{Methods - From water volume to financial considerations}
\label{section:Theory_yields}
This research methodology contains the required information to make a simplified financial balance on an operational ASR system. The section is split in two. On the one hand, the section presents yield  information. Components as the crops of interest, the irrigation efficiency and the applied exchange rate are addressed. On the other hand, the operation costs are defined. The process from power consumption, due to water withdrawal, to the determination of fuel costs is specified.

\subsection{Yield - crops of interest}
Some crops need more water than others. Some crops thrive better in northern Ghana climate than other. Some crops are financially more beneficial than others. And so, many more elements are decisive in the process of crop type determination. This research is not about crop type decisions. The crops are purely included in the study to gain knowledge on hand-on possibilities in the agricultural use and financial feasibility of an ASR-system in northern Ghana. It is chosen to consider the tomato and groundnut crops.\\
%Keeping northern Ghana applicability in mind a selection of crops is made.

	\label{fig:Crops}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item{Tomato} \\
The worldwide second most important vegetable crop (after the potato) concerns the tomato. Because of its relative high (financial) yield, the vegetable is a desired crop for cultivation. After a period of approximately 90 to 120 days the seeds are grown to fully-fledged crops, the tomatoes are ready for harvesting. Over the growth season the crop thrives best by the supply of 400 to 600 mm of water (rain-fed). To reduce the chances of deceases (pests and infestations) the crop should be cultivated in rotation with other crops. Under the conditions of irrigation the tomato yield is approximately 45 to 65 ton/ha \citep{FAO2018a}. Because of the broad ranges in agricultural yield and water requirements (moreover, only rain-fed statistics), these specific crop competences are not taken into account in research. The derivation of agricultural yield is based on the average 'water utilization efficiency' ($E_y$). For the transformation of agricultural yield to financial benefits, the Esoko march 2018 Ghana average wholesale price is used. The tomato wholesale price is set at a value ranging from 217.86 to 220.43 GHS for a 52 kg crate \citep{ModernGhana2018}. For the purposes of this research the highest average value is applied. To summarize: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Length growth season: 120 (d)}
\item{Water utilization efficiency: $E_y$ = 11 (kg/m$^3$)}
\item{Wholesale price: 4.239 (GHS/kg)}
\end{itemize}

\item{Groundnut} \\
The groundnut is an above average profitable crop grown in Ghana. Production is often the responsibility of small holder farmers in the North. Almost the complete Ghana groundnut production originates here \citep{Ghana-made2018}. Growth season length is dependent on the varieties (sequential or alternately). In general harvesting can take place after a period of 90 to 140 days. For a proper single season production, groundnut crops require approximately 500 to 700 mm of water. Rain-fed crops can produce average yields of 2-3 ton/ha unshelled nuts. By the introduction of irrigation these values even reach 3.5-4.5 ton/ha \citep{FoodandAgriculturalOrganisationoftheUnitedNationsFAO2018a}.  At the contrary, a 2016 Ghana average agricultural yield of 1.25 ton/ha unshelled groundnut is perceived \citep{FoodandAgriculturalOrganisationoftheUnitedNationsFAO2018}. 
In other words, groundnut crop yield are not unambiguous. The \citet{FoodandAgriculturalOrganisationoftheUnitedNationsFAO2018a} average water utilization efficiency ($E_y$) is adapted as normative. Financial yields are highly fluctuating over time. Market forces are dominant in actual returns. The march Esoko 2018 Ghana average unshelled groundnut wholesale price is set at a value ranging from 247.50 to 282.50 GHS for a 82 kg bag \citep{ModernGhana2018}. For the purposes of this research the highest average value is applied and interpreted as the unshelled groundnut price. To summarize:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Length growth season: 123 (d)}
\item{Water utilization efficiency: $E_y$ = 0.7 (kg/m$^3$)}
\item{Wholesale price: 3.445 (GHS/kg)}
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

As stated before, the time frame of the synthetic simulation consist of 243 days of dry season. It is assumed two consecutive growth seasons fit this period. The tomato growth season is succeeded by a growth season labelled for the production of groundnut. This complies with the desire of rotational crop cultivation. \\

The applied crop specifications are dominated by supreme rough assumptions in e.g. quantity (kg) and prices. The obtained (financial) yields should solely be interpreted as indicative. In other words, "All rights reserved". \\
 
\textbf{Irrigation efficiency} \\
The dry season agriculture is assumed to be purely dependent on irrigation for the supply of water. Different types of irrigation are suitable in northern Ghana. One can think of border strip/furrow irrigation; simplistic but inefficient. Higher degrees of efficiency can be achieved by the use of sprinkler irrigation. In the particular case of ASR-system use, minimum water losses are pursued. Therefore, drip irrigation is applied. Drip irrigation is the type of irrigation with the highest efficiencies. Systems are standard paired with facilities as poly-tank(s), pipes and drip hoses. Distances between extraction and irrigation are small, resulting in limited losses. However, water losses are present due to pipe connections and potential evaporation. All-encompassing, a irrigation system efficiency of 0.8 (-) is considered. 80\% of all water withdrawn is assumed to be net usable for crop growth \citep{VandeGiesen2013}. Note, this efficiency number also accounts for the in practice required schedule in irrigation water amounts. Over the growth season the required water volumes are here  hypothetical and assumed to be daily equal. \\
%
%\textbf{Cover area (crop specific)} \\
%Water volumes obtained in previous research sections are basic input for the determination of agricultural field sizes. Net withdrawn (dry season) total volumes are divided by the crop specific water footprint. The areal outcome is halved to correct for the double (consecutive) growth periods in a single dry season.   
%
%\begin{equation}
% A = \frac{V_{out,tot} * \eta_{irrigation}}{2 * Water footprint_{crop}} 
%\label{eq:A}
%\end{equation}
%
%Where, A (m$^2$) is the agricultural field area, $V_{out,tot}$ (m$^3$) is the dry season total volume discharged, $\eta_{irrigation}$ (-) is the irrigation efficiency and $Water footprint_{crop}$ (m) is the crop specific water footprint. \\
%
%The extraction of water leaves marks on nature. Pump operation causes a groundwater cone of depression. Close range (and most definitely in-well) drawdown is significant. At an increased radial distance impact losses magnitude. For system spatial multiplication it is of interest to define a maximum circular area in-which groundwater is affected. The groundwater cone of influence (G) is defined as the area corresponding with the maximum radius from well at which the groundwater drawdown is labelled as significant. In this study, significance is assumed to be bounded by a drawdown of 1.0 m at any moment in year. \\

%
%The A over G ratio ($C_{\%}$) shows top-view perspectives of spatially concatenated multiplication of agricultural fields, as visualized in Figure (\ref{fig:Crop_cover}). High $C_{\%}$ values (close to one) suggest the implementation of agricultural fields is possible at close mutual distance. \\
%
%\begin{equation}
% C_{\%} = \frac{A}{G}
%\label{eq:RR}
%\end{equation}
%
%Where  C$_{\%}$ is the crop cover ratio (-), $A$ (m$^2$) is the crop specific agricultural field size and $G$ (m$^2$) is the areal groundwater cone of influence. \\

\textbf{Financial yield} \\
Based on the described crop specification, the simulated water volumes withdrawn can be expressed in financial returns. The agricultural yield (kg/m$^3$) and the weighted crop prices (GHS/kg) are defined. From consistence considerations it is chosen to express the financial returns in US dollars. The July 7$th$ Bloomberg financial exchange rate is applied: 0.2081 USD/GHS \citep{Bloomberg2018}.

\subsection{Costs - water withdrawal}
Profits are accompanied by costs. For this research all Capital Expenditures(CAPEX) are unknown and ignored. The same applies for large parts of the Operating Expenses (OPEX), e.g. farmer wage and fertilizer costs. The only costs accounted are related to the energy (diesel) consumption. Outcomes are purely focused on the feasibility of the daily system operation. An impression is generated, whether or not regular ASR-system operation on its own is profitable. \\

 \label{fig:Schematic_pump_costs}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Synthetic pump application} \\
The Pedrollo 4" submergence pump is applied in fieldwork measurements. The same pump, i.e. its specifications, is used a standard in the subsequent parts of research. General specification can be found in Appendix \ref{chapter:Pedrollo_product_specs}. The results of the synthetic simulations contains time dependent (4 hours daily, 243 days) discharge rates. As soon as the maximum pumping capacity is exceeded, it is assumed the specific simulation is carried out by the implementation of an extra (same) pump. By a parallel pump configuration the same heads and efficiencies are ensured, while discharge capacities are doubled \citep{VandeGiesen2013}. \\ 
%As soon as the maximum pumping capacity is exceeded by the obtained (simulated) discharge rates (results Chapter \ref{chapter:model_scenarios}),

\textbf{Energy Consumption} \\
The available groundwater has to be lifted to the surface. Depends on the obtained discharges, the lifting action requires a certain magnitude of power (Equation \ref{N_net}). For water displacement the difference between pump position and surface level (30m) is retained. An extra lift of 15 m is added to account for friction losses and the higher position (above surface) of the poly tank(s). A total head lift of 45 m is applied.

\begin{equation}
N_{net} =  g * Q * \Delta H
\label{N_net}
\end{equation}

Where $N_{net}$ (kW) is the net power required, g (m/s$^2$) is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s$^2$), Q (m$^3$/s) is the discharge (total extracted volume of water over the yearly sum of pumping time (in seconds)) and $\Delta$H (m) is the net head (total lift) required. In this equation it is assumed the water has a density of 1000 kg/m$^3$. \\

In general, the use of power gets accompanied by losses (for example due to friction and turbulence). Ever single power-related equipment works at a certain level of efficiency. The power generator applied in fieldwork (Appendix \ref{chapter:fieldwork_set-up}) is used over years. Due to its datedness, a generator efficiency of 70\% is estimated. The efficiency of the Pedrollo pump(s) is dependent on the discharge rate. An overview of the efficiency curve is present in Appendix \ref{chapter:Pedrollo_product_specs}. In this study, the pump efficiencies are related to the time dependent discharges obtained in the synthetic model simulations. Besides equipment losses, energy get lost due to mutual transmission. An extra efficiency value of 90\% is accounted \citep{VandeGiesen2013}. Result is a variable ASR-system efficiency of that never exceeds 36.5 \% (based on maximum pump efficiency).

\begin{equation}
 \eta_{total} =   \eta_{generator} * \eta_{transmission} * \eta_{pump} \end{equation}

Where $\eta_{total}$ (-) is the overall power efficiency, $\eta_{generator}$ (-) is the generator power efficiency, $\eta_{transmission}$ (-) is the transmission power efficiency and $\eta_{pump}$ (-) is the pump power efficiency. \\

The combination of total ASR-system efficiency and net required power results in a gross power \ref{Eq:gross}. The gross power should be delivered by the generator to gain the desired volumes of water at the agricultural fields. Multiplying the gross power required by the total hours of pump operation returns the total energy consumed (kWh).

\begin{equation}
 N_{gross} =   \frac{N_{net}}{\eta_{total}}
\label{Eq:gross}
\end{equation}

Where $N_{gross}$ (kW) is the gross power required, $N_{net}$ (kW) is the net power required and $\eta_{total}$ (-) is the overall power efficiency. \\

\textbf{Energy costs} \\
The Kipor power generator (Appendix \ref{chapter:fieldwork_set-up}) contains a 15 litre diesel tank. On a full tank the generator can operate for 6.5 hours. A fuel consumption of 2.31 l/h is taken into account. During operation the generator delivers a continuous power capacity of 4.5 kW \citep{TS242018}. Ghana diesel price of 5.03 GHS/l (begin of July) is adopted as normative \citep{GlobalPetrolPrices2018}. The Bloomberg financial exchange rate (0.2081 USD/GHS) is once again applied on the fuel costs for proper comparison with the agricultural yield \citep{Bloomberg2018}.

\begin{equation}
 Cost_{fuel} =  \frac{consump_{gen} * price_{fuel} * rate_{exchange}}{power_{gen}}
\end{equation}

Where $Cost_{fuel}$ (USD/kWh) is the price of fuel,  $consump_{gen}$ (l/h) is the generator fuel consumption,  $price_{fuel}$ (GHS/l) is the fuel price in Ghana, $rate_{exchange}$ (USD/GHS) is the Bloomberg financial currency rate and $power_{gen}$ (kW) is the generator continuous power capacity. \\

\section{Financial yield}
\label{section:fin_yield}
* The obtained results are all based on volume-to-yield transformations described in Section \ref{section:Theory_yields}. \\
%\subsection{Financial yield}

The available water volumes are approximately the same for the first four months (tomatoes) and the subsequent four months (groundnut) of dry season. Nonetheless, the obtained yield differ strongly. Note, the y-axis of Figure \ref{fig:tom_yield} and Figure \ref{fig:gn_yield} are not the same. The obtained financial yield is highly dependent on the crop of interest and its transfer assumptions. \\

\section{Pumping costs}
\label{section:pump_costs}
The pumping curve of the Pedrollo 4" submergence pump is defined as normative \ref{chapter:Pedrollo_product_specs}. In multiple soil scenarios and types of improvement the obtained discharges are far out of pumping range. Based on the predefined approach multiple pumps are set-up in a parallel operation. However, the increase in pump numbers is not reflected in this research costs. As a consequence, unrealistic judgements and comparisons are applied. \\

The obtained (model) discharges for the soil scenarios 1 and 2 are extremely low. As a consequence, pumping efficiencies (Pedrollo 4" submergence pumping curve) are stated to be almost zero. A situation highly unlikely. In practise, a specific pump type will be applied that suits the circumstances. As a consequence, unrealistic judgements and comparisons are applied.

\end{figure}

Note, the outlier in the soil scenarios 4 and 5 for the situation of 7 hours pumping operation can be justified by the application of an unfortunate number of pumps. Efficiencies are in this particular case relatively low (as low as 35\%). \\

Bovendien kunnen onderdelen vanuit (europese) fondsen in aanmerking komen voor een fianciele compensatie. waardoor het financiele kostenplaatje al weer iets minder onrealistisch is. nonetheless, business case blijft hoogst onzeker. verder onderzoek dan ook zeker wenselijk.
