abstract = {Knowledge about the hydraulics of water wells is important to optimize their energy efficiency. By minimizing head losses around the well, energy consumption and ageing processes can be limited, thereby prolonging the well's service life. The contribution of the individual components to total head loss (drawdown) in the well is analyzed in detail.The single most important contributor to drawdown is commonly the aquifer. Its hydraulic conductivity can only be improved slightly through development. The second most important contributor is the formation of a wellbore skin layer. This occurs if no proper well development was performed after drilling; the layer contains remnants of drilling-fluid additives or mobilized fine aquifer particles. The head loss caused by groundwater flow in the gravel pack, through the screen slots and inside the well, was found to be small. Thus, well development is the most important measure to influence well performance and energy efficiency. For longer operation times and pumped volumes, the energy gains outperform the cost for the development},

Frequently there is a need to solve additional equations; for example, transport equations and equations for estimating parameter values that produce the closest match between model-calculated heads and flows and measured values. This report documents a new version of MODFLOW, called MODFLOW-2000, which is designed to accommodate the solution of equations in addition to the ground-water flow equation.

abstract = {Since declaring independence in 1957, the Republic of Ghana has become a stable constitutional democracy. Ghana's economy has grown substantially over the past decade, yet remains primarily agrarian, accounting for 50{\%} of the total employment and 25{\%} of the country's Gross Domestic Product. Smallholder rain-fed farming using rudimentary technologies dominates the agricultural sector accounting for 80{\%} of total agricultural production. Approximately 90{\%} of smallholder farms are less than two hectares in size, and produce a diversity of crops. The major crops cultivated in Ghana include numerous cereal, root and tuber, leguminous, fruit, vegetable and industrial crops. Maize is the most widely cultivated crop in Ghana, and accounts for a significant proportion of the daily caloric intake. However, significant yield gaps exist where actual maize yields are 50 to 80{\%} less than achievable yields. The following document was written after conducting a three month 2012 summer internship in Ghana as an agronomic expert volunteer for the Ghana Agricultural Development and Value Chain Enhancement (ADVANCE) Project. My primary objectives included monitoring ADVANCE crop production demonstration plots and farmers' fields to diagnose and address crop health issues, with the goal of identifying why smallholders in the north continue to get lower than expected yields even when good agronomic practices (GAPs) are being implemented. Observations indicate GAPs are not being adopted, partly because they are not often being implemented correctly at demonstration plots. The benefits of GAPs can be better realized through improved planning, communication, cooperation and education among all participants. This document is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is an introduction to the Republic of Ghana. Chapter 2 is a brief introduction to agriculture production in Ghana, emphasizing agriculture in the northern savannah and the major challenges facing development in the north. Chapter 3 is a detailed summary of my experience working on the ADVANCE Project. The final chapter discusses how agricultural development—in particular maize productivity—can be improved in the northern savannah of Ghana.},

abstract = {This report documents a Newton formulation of MODFLOW-2005, called MODFLOW-NWT. MODFLOW- NWT is a standalone program that is intended for solving problems involving drying and rewetting nonlinearities of the unconfined groundwater-flow equation. MODFLOW- NWT must be used with the Upstream-Weighting (UPW) Package for calculating intercell conductances in a different manner than is done in the Block-Centered Flow (BCF), Layer Property Flow (LPF), or Hydrogeologic-Unit Flow (HUF; Anderman and Hill, 2000) Packages. TheUPW Package treats nonlinearities of cell drying and rewetting by use of a continuous function of groundwater head, rather than the discrete approach of drying and rewetting that is used by the BCF, LPF, and HUF Packages. This further enables application of the Newton formulation for unconfined groundwater-flow problems because conductance derivatives required by the Newton method are smooth over the full range of head for a model cell. The NWT linearization approach generates an asymmetric matrix, which is different from the standard MODFLOW formulation that generates a symmetric matrix. Because all linear solvers presently available for use with MODFLOW-2005 solve only symmetric matrices, MODFLOW-NWT includes two previously developed asymmetric matrix-solver options. The matrix-solver options include a generalized-minimum-residual (GMRES) Solver and an Orthomin / stabilized conjugate-gradient (CGSTAB) Solver. The GMRES Solver is documented in a previously published report, such that only a brief description and input instructions are provided in this report. However, the CGSTAB Solver (called $\chi$MD) is documented in this report. Flow-property input for the UPW Package is designed based on the LPF Package and material-property input is identical to that for the LPF Package except that the rewetting and vertical-conductance correction options of the LPF Package are not available with the UPW Package. Input files constructed for the LPF Package can be used with slight modification as input for the UPW Package. This report presents the theory and methods used by MODFLOW-NWT,including the UPW Package. Additionally, this report provides comparisons of the new methodology to analytical solutions of groundwater flow and to standard MODFLOW-2005 results by use of an unconfined aquifer MODFLOW example problem. The standard MODFLOW-2005 simulation uses the LPF Package with the wet/dry option active. A new example problem also is presented to demonstrate MODFLOW- NWT's ability to provide a solution for a difficult unconfined groundwater-flow problem.},

abstract = {Analytic and semi-analytic solution are often used by researchers and practicioners to estimate aquifer parameters from unconfined aquifer pumping tests. The non-linearities associated with unconfined (i.e., water table) aquifer tests makes their analysis more complex than confined tests. Although analytical solutions for unconfined flow began in the mid-1800s with Dupuit, Thiem was possibly the first to use them to estimate aquifer parameters from pumping tests in the early 1900s. In the 1950s, Boulton developed the first transient well test solution specialized to unconfined flow. By the 1970s Neuman had developed solutions considering both primary transient storage mechanisms (confined storage and delayed yield) without non-physical fitting parameters. In the last decade, research into developing unconfined aquifer test solutions has mostly focused on explicitly coupling the aquifer with the linearized vadose zone. Despite the many advanced solution methods available, there still exists a need for realism to accurately simulate real-world aquifer tests.},

No grid or time-stepping is required, nor does a closed model boundary need to be specified in any of the layers. Currently, TTim includes multi-layer wells and line-sinks, which may be used to simulate transient flow to a variety of hydrogeologic features, including wells with a skin and wellbore storage, incompletely sealed abandoned wells, streams with leaky beds, vertical faults, and horizontal wells; transient forcing needs to be represented by a step function. Other features that may be simulated include vertical anisotropy and the delayed response of the water table. Behind the scenes of TTim, the Laplace-transform analytic element method is applied. TTim is written in Python, with Python scripts used as input files. TTim has many practical applications, including the design of riverbank filtration systems, analysis of aquifer tests near surface-water bodies, design and evaluation of recirculation wells, and modeling of the transient pressure response of proposed carbon geologic sequestration projects. In addition, the short and simple input files and the one-to-one link between analytic elements and hydrogeologic features make TTim well suited for education. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Unmodified versions of common computer programs such as MODFLOW, MT3DMS, and SEAWAT that use Cartesian geometry can accurately simulate axially symmetric ground water flow and solute transport. Axisymmetric flow and transport are simulated by adjusting several input parameters to account for the increase in flow area with radial distance from the injection or extraction well. Logarithmic weighting of interblock transmissivity, a standard option in MODFLOW, can be used for axisymmetric models to represent the linear change in hydraulic conductance within a single finite-difference cell. Results from three test problems (ground water extraction, an aquifer push-pull test, and upconing of saline water into an extraction well) show good agreement with analytical solutions or with results from other numerical models designed specifically to simulate the axisymmetric geometry. Axisymmetric models are not commonly used but can offer an efficient alternative to full three-dimensional models, provided the assumption of axial symmetry can be justified. For the upconing problem, the axisymmetric model was more than 1000 times faster than an equivalent three-dimensional model. Computational gains with the axisymmetric models may be useful for quickly determining appropriate levels of grid resolution for three-dimensional models and for estimating aquifer parameters from field tests.},

abstract = {Wells that are open to multiple aquifers can provide preferential pathways to flow and solute transport that short- circuit normal fluid flowlines. Representing these features in a regional flow model can produce a more realistic and reliable simulation model. This report describes modifications to the Multi-Node Well (MNW) Package of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) three-dimensional ground-water flow model (MODFLOW). The modifications build on a previous version and add several new features, processes, and input and output options. The input structure of the revised MNW (MNW2) is more well-centered than the original verion of MNW (MNW1) and allows the user to easily define hydraulic characteristics of each multi-node well. MNW2 also allows calculations of additional head changes due to partial penetration effects, flow into a borehole through a seepage face, changes in well discharge related to changes in lift for a given pump, and intraborehole flows with a pump intake located at any speci- fied depth within the well. MNW2 also offers an improved capability to simulate nonvertical wells. A new output option allows selected multi-node wells to be designated as “observa- tion wells” for which changes in selected variables with time will be written to separate output files to facilitate postprocess- ing. MNW2 is compatible with the MODFLOW–2000 and MODFLOW–2005 versions of MODFLOW and with the ver- sion of MODFLOW that includes the Ground-Water Transport process (MODFLOW–GWT).

For MODFLOW-based models, the FloPy package was developed by the authors to construct model input files, run the model, and read and plot simulation results. Use of Python with the available scientific packages and FloPy facilitates data exploration, alternative model evaluations, and model analyses that can be difficult to perform with GUIs. Furthermore, Python scripts are a complete, transparent, and repeatable record of the modeling process. The approach is introduced with a simple FloPy example to create and postprocess a MODFLOW model. A more complicated capture-fraction analysis with a real-world model is presented to demonstrate the types of analyses that can be performed using Python and FloPy.},
