\textbf{Discussion - $T$ \& $S$ bandwidth definition} \\
The defined scope can not be interpreted as a generalization of the different locations. Not a single combination of the upper and lower parameter boundaries is the one-on-one representation of a specific location. The bandwidth predominantly acts as an input for scenario modelling in the subsequent parts of this research. Outcome of these scenarios are perhaps quantitatively incorrect, but can qualitatively be interpreted as indication for the impact of ASR-system improvements within northern Ghana. 

\textbf{Discussion - Synthetic model definition} \\
The research base model results do not apply to a single research location (depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Overviewlocations}). The applied simplified model conditions serve research purposes. Assumptions made, are not by definition realistic. One can for example imagine the actual wet season inundation levels will fluctuate over time. And in practice, groundwater withdrawal needs day-specific tuning (not constant for 243 days) with respect to agricultural needs. Aspects advisable to take into account in further research.\\
